# :black_joker: A simplified Blackjack Game :black_joker:

### :spades: Fundamentals in JS Objects and Arrays 

The goal of this project was to work on renforcing knowledge in *Functions, Objects, and Arrays*. While also working on *for* loops and *event listeners*. 

### :hearts: How it is simplifed

You'll notice that you will never draw a "face" card (ex. King, Queen, Jack) or an Ace card. Instead these values have been 10 and 11 respectivly. Also, in blackjack the Ace card counts as either 11 or 1 depending on your card count, however the Ace card has a single value of 11. Finally, this is a solitare blackjack game. There is no computer player, and thus no one to 'win' against. 

### :clubs: The Future of the Project

As I continue developing my JS skill, I will most likely come back to this game to fix the mentioned simplifications. I would also very much like to add a betting element that gives the user money to win/lose. A strech goal for this game will be to add a multiplayer element.
